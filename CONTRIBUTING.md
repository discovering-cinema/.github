# Contributing to Discovering Cinema

Thank you for exploring Discovering Cinema. You're stepping into a project that treats *recommendation and discovery as creative inquiry*, not just engineering.

This document explains how you can meaningfully contribute while we collectively refine ideas and tools.

## Guiding Principles

This project values:
- Experimentation - we try things, learn, and iterate
- Transparency - we want to know *why* something works
- Conversation - differing perspectives deepen understanding
- Explanation - recommendations should be explainable and traceable

You don't need polished code to contribute. Thoughtful questions, proposals, and critiques are extremely valuable.

## Ways to Contribute

You can help by:
- Opening issues that raise questions, hypotheses, or edge cases
- Suggesting features or approaches
- Sharing academic references or outside inspirations
- Writing tooling, prototypes, or scripts
- Improving documentation and clarifying concepts

Experiments are welcome - even when they challenge existing assumptions.

## Starting Work

If your contribution is code or design:
- Describe your intent in an issue before heavy work
- Tell us *why* this is interesting or useful
- Link relevant concepts or blog posts

This helps set context and avoids duplicated efforts.

## Pull Requests

Please:
- Use thoughtful, respectful language
- Focus on ideas, not individuals
- Be clear about what you're proposing and why
