# Discovering Cinema

**Discovering Cinema** is an exploration of how films connect to human curiosity, creativity, and surprise.

This project grows out of a desire for more thoughtful discovery tools - not engines that chase engagement metrics, but systems that help uncover **films you didn't know you needed**. It sits at the intersection of data, recommendation, philosophy, and experience.

You'll find that this project explores **why** we recommend, not just **what** we recommend.

## What This Project Is

- An inquiry into how discovery can work *beyond popularity bias*
- A set of data tools and pipelines for film metadata
- A space for experimenting with alternative recommendation signals
- A hub for creative and technical contributions toward human-centered film discovery

## What This Project Is Not

- A slick, finished product
- A "Netflix clone"
- A commitment to any one algorithm

This project acknowledges that *understanding is a process.* Coming to conlusions is part of experimentation.

## Philosophy of Discovery

Instead of optimizing watch time, Discovering Cinema aims to:
- Respect the **ambiguity** in human taste
- Surface films based on **unexpected relevance**
- Explore *why* something resonates, not just that it does
- Build transparent systems where recommendations can be explained

## How to Engage

Everyone's perspective enriches the conversation. You can:
- Read and refine the ideas here
- Build new tools and prototypes
- Improve documentation
- Share insights from other discovery or recommender work
- Discuss philosophical questions around taste, discovery, and data
